# MA304-DataVisualization-Center-for-Policing-Equity
Overview:

This data set is provided over the Kaggle where it was opened as a competition some years ago. It actually defined all about the CPE (center for policing equity) where they include different bodies in a system to discuss about justice and fairness. Their main aim is the use of data science with the combination of data analysis and machine learning to provide racial equity, safety in the public and their trust. Maily police departments have joined justice database in Dallas, Texas to provide access to the dataset in 2016 about different bodies where they are discuss about different offenses and violations.

Summary:

This html file summaries about the project where as a student of 304-Data Visualization student, I have calculated different analysis results from the given data set between different bodies of the system. Data analysis can tell us about racism happening in the police department. What factors are there which are the main cause of the racism and how it can be improved. Also lettin police department know that how crimes are decreasing and what could be achieved to control it further.
